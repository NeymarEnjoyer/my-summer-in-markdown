# My summer in Markdown
## Summer Activities
Over summer i spent it going to the gym for free at planet fitness most week days and then just chilling unless I had something to do. I also spent some time playing soccer and hanging out with friends
## Favorite Summer memories with friends
By far my favorite memories were in the gym eventhough I only spent about an hour in there, I had fun pushing myself most days and seeing my friends puch themselves. I developed the most muscle out of everyone in the group, I have strechmarks to show off
## Summer travel experiences
I went to San Diego with my family for about a week the trip was fun because I was out most days but Sand Diego is a pretty boring place in general.
## Favorite summer food
My favorite thing to eat over summer was grilled chicken, its relatively low calorie with high protein and is always good when cooked right.
## Favorite movies and shows
Over summer I spent time watching lots of shows and some movies, my favorites were SpongeBob, Dexter, and The boys. Those 3 are all some of my recent favorites spongebob isn't so recent but it'll always be top 3 for me. One good movie I watched was The End of Watch
